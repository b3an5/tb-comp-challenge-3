# tb-comp-challenge-3
I felt like this was my best effort yet when it comes to the static comps. I spent more time on this one and got a better feel for flex and media queries. 
the biggest challenge that I faced was naming the classes, towards the end I started having trouble naming each button or groups of buttons.
I have 5 media queries that I think helps make it a smooth transition from the biggest of screens to small ones as small as the iphone 5.
the one thing I had trouble with was trying to make the graph and circle section look ok on giant screens but I think it looks alright.
